# 🤖 Azure Robotics Reference Architecture with NVIDIA OSMO

This reference architecture provides a production-ready framework for orchestrating robotics and AI workloads on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) using NVIDIA technologies such as [Isaac Lab](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/lab), [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim), and [OSMO](https://developer.nvidia.com/osmo).
It demonstrates end-to-end reinforcement learning workflows, scalable training pipelines, and deployment processes with Azure-native authentication, storage, and ML services.

## 🚀 Key Features

OSMO handles workflow orchestration and job scheduling while Azure provides elastic GPU compute, persistent checkpointing, MLflow experiment tracking, and enterprise grade security.

- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform modules referencing [microsoft/edge-ai](https://github.com/microsoft/edge-ai) components for reproducible deployments
- **Containerized Workflows** - Docker-based Isaac Lab training with NVIDIA GPU support
- **CI/CD Integration** - Automated deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions
- **MLflow Integration** - Automatic experiment tracking and model versioning
  - Automatic metric logging from SKRL agents to Azure ML
  - Comprehensive tracking of episode statistics, losses, optimization metrics, and timing data
  - Configurable logging intervals and metric filtering
  - See [MLflow Integration Guide](docs/mlflow-integration.md) for details
- **Scalable Compute** - Auto-scaling GPU nodes based on workload demands
- **Cost Optimization** - Pay-per-use compute with automatic scaling
- **Enterprise Security** - Entra ID integration
- **Global Deployment** - Multi-region support for worldwide teams

## 🗼 Architecture Overview

This reference architecture integrates:

- **NVIDIA OSMO** - Workflow orchestration and job scheduling
- **Azure Machine Learning** - Experiment tracking and model management
- **Azure Kubernetes Service** - Software in the Loop (SIL) training
- **Azure Arc for Kubernetes** - Software in the Loop (SIL) and Hardware in the Loop (HIL) training

## 🌍 Real World Examples

**OSMO orchestration** on Azure enables production-scale robotics training across industries. Some examples include:

- **Warehouse AMRs** - Train navigation policies with 1000+ parallel environments on auto-scaling AKS GPU nodes, checkpoint to Azure Storage, track experiments in Azure ML
- **Manufacturing Arms** - Develop manipulation strategies with physics-accurate simulation, leveraging Azure's global regions for distributed teams and pay-per-use GPU compute
- **Legged Robots** - Optimize locomotion policies with MLflow experiment tracking for sim-to-real transfer
- **Collaborative Robots** - Create safe interaction policies with Azure Monitor logging and metrics, enabling compliance auditing and performance diagnostics at scale

See [OSMO workflow examples](workflows/osmo/) for job configuration templates.

## 🧑🏽‍💻 Prerequisites and Requirements

### Required Tools

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Python package manager and environment tool
- Python 3.11 (required by Isaac Sim 5.X)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (v2.50+)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) (v1.5+)
- [NVIDIA OSMO CLI](https://developer.nvidia.com/osmo) (latest)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- [hve-core](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core) - Copilot-assisted development workflows ([install guide](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/docs/getting-started/install.md))

### Azure Requirements

- Azure subscription with contributor access
- Sufficient quota for GPU VMs (Standard_NC6s_v3 or higher)
- Azure Machine Learning workspace (or permissions to create one)

### NVIDIA Requirements

- NVIDIA Developer account with OSMO access
- NGC API key for container registry access

## 🏃‍➡️ Quick Start

```bash
./setup-dev.sh
```

The setup script installs Python 3.11 via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), creates a virtual environment at `.venv/`, and installs training dependencies.

Install [hve-core](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/docs/getting-started/install.md) for Copilot-assisted development workflows. The simplest method is the [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core).

### VS Code Configuration

The workspace is configured with `python.analysis.extraPaths` pointing to `src/`, enabling imports like:

```python
from training.utils import AzureMLContext, bootstrap_azure_ml
```

Select the `.venv/bin/python` interpreter in VS Code for IntelliSense support

The workspace `.vscode/settings.json` also configures Copilot Chat to load instructions, prompts, and chat modes from hve-core:

| Setting                           | hve-core Paths                                                               |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chat.modeFilesLocations`         | `../hve-core/.github/chatmodes`, `../hve-core/copilot/beads/chatmodes`       |
| `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` | `../hve-core/.github/instructions`, `../hve-core/copilot/beads/instructions` |
| `chat.promptFilesLocations`       | `../hve-core/.github/prompts`, `../hve-core/copilot/beads/prompts`           |

These paths resolve when hve-core is installed as a peer directory or via the VS Code Extension. Without hve-core, Copilot still functions but shared conventions, prompts, and chat modes are unavailable.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Once a `tests/` directory exists, run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

Run tests selectively by category:

```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, no external dependencies)
uv run pytest tests/ -m "not slow and not gpu"
```

See the [Testing Requirements](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-requirements) section in CONTRIBUTING.md for test organization, markers, and coverage targets.

## 🧹 Cleanup and Uninstall

Reverse the changes made by `setup-dev.sh` and tear down deployed infrastructure.

### Remove Development Environment

```bash
# Remove Python virtual environment
rm -rf .venv

# Remove cloned IsaacLab repository
rm -rf external/IsaacLab

# Remove Node.js linting dependencies (if installed separately via npm install)
rm -rf node_modules

# Remove uv cache (optional, frees disk space)
uv cache clean
```

### Destroy Azure Infrastructure

```bash
cd deploy/001-iac
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

> [!WARNING]
> `terraform destroy` permanently deletes all deployed Azure resources including storage, AKS clusters, and Key Vault. Ensure training data and model checkpoints are backed up before destroying infrastructure.

See [Cost Considerations](docs/contributing/cost-considerations.md) for details on resource costs and cleanup timing.
