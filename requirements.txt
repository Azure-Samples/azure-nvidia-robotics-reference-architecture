# Isaac Lab Training Environment Dependencies
# This file contains all packages needed for running Isaac Lab training workflows
# These dependencies are typically pre-installed in the Isaac Sim container environment

# Python Version: 3.11 (for Isaac Sim 5.0) or 3.10 (for Isaac Sim 4.5)

# NOTE: This requirements.txt is intended for the Isaac Lab container environment (Linux)
# For local development on macOS, most of these packages are not needed or not available
# The setup-dev.sh script handles platform-specific installation

# Core PyTorch with CUDA support (Linux only)
# Note: Removed for local aarch64 dev - Isaac Sim containers have these pre-installed
# --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
# torch==2.7.0; sys_platform == 'linux'
# torchvision==0.22.0; sys_platform == 'linux'

# Isaac Sim (when installing via pip - Linux only)
# --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
# isaacsim[all,extscache]==5.0.0; # sys_platform == 'linux'

# Isaac Lab Extensions
# Note: Removed for local aarch64 dev - not available on aarch64
# For local dev, we clone IsaacLab to external/ for intellisense only
# Isaac Sim containers have these pre-installed for training
# isaaclab[all]==2.2.0
