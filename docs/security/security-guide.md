## Your Deployment Responsibilities

### Before Deployment

- Conduct a security assessment for your target environment
- Review all Terraform variables and override defaults inappropriate for your security posture
- Evaluate network topology (private vs. public endpoints) for your requirements
- Establish secret management policies (rotation schedules, access controls)
- Verify Azure subscription security baselines (Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud)

### During Operation

- Monitor AKS cluster security events through Azure Monitor
- Review Kubernetes RBAC bindings and service account permissions
- Manage container image provenance and vulnerability scanning
- Maintain network policy definitions appropriate for running workloads

### Ongoing Maintenance

- Update Terraform provider versions and module references
- Patch base container images and NVIDIA runtime components
- Review Azure Advisor security recommendations
- Reassess security posture when adding workloads or scaling

## Security Considerations Checklist

> [!NOTE]
> This checklist highlights common security considerations for Azure and Kubernetes

## Terraform State Security

This architecture uses a local Terraform state backend by default. Local state stores infrastructure details including resource IDs, network addresses, and configuration values in an unencrypted file on disk.

For team environments or production deployments, consider migrating to a remote backend with encryption. Refer to the [Terraform Azure backend documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/azurerm) for configuration details.
