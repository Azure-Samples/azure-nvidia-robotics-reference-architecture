|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Threat Model](threat-model.md)                   | STRIDE-based threat analysis and remediation roadmap             |
| [Security Guide for Deployers](security-guide.md) | Security configuration inventory and deployment responsibilities |

## 🔒 Security Posture

This reference architecture deploys AKS clusters with GPU node pools, Azure Machine Learning, and NVIDIA OSMO for robotics training and inference. All components are infrastructure-as-code artifacts; no hosted service or user-facing application exists.

The [threat model](threat-model.md) documents:

- 19 threats across STRIDE categories
- Security controls mapped to each threat
- Trust boundary analysis across IaC, cluster, and ML pipeline layers
- Prioritized remediation roadmap

The [security guide](security-guide.md) documents:

- Default security configurations shipped with the architecture
- Deployer responsibilities before, during, and after deployment
- Security considerations checklist with Azure documentation references
