## 📋 Prerequisites

* Platform infrastructure deployed (`cd deploy/001-iac && terraform apply`)
* Core variables matching parent deployment (`environment`, `resource_prefix`, `location`)

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
cd deploy/001-iac/automation

# Configure schedule and resources
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your schedule

terraform init && terraform apply
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Example `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
environment     = "dev"
location        = "westus3"
resource_prefix = "rob"
instance        = "001"

should_start_postgresql = true

schedule_config = {
  start_time = "13:00"
  week_days  = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
  timezone   = "UTC"
}
```

## 📦 Resources Created

* Azure Automation Account with system-assigned managed identity
* PowerShell 7.2 runbook for starting resources
