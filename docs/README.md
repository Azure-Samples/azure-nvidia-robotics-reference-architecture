Technical documentation for deploying, training, and operating robotics workloads on Azure with NVIDIA Isaac and OSMO. This index organizes every guide, reference, and walkthrough in the repository by topic so you can find what you need based on where you are in the workflow.

Documentation spans the full lifecycle — from provisioning Azure infrastructure with Terraform, through training reinforcement-learning policies with Isaac Lab and AzureML, to running inference on edge devices. Each section targets a specific audience and phase of the project.
