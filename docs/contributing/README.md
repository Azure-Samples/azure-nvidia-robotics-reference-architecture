Contributions improve this reference architecture for the robotics and AI community. This project accepts contributions for infrastructure code (Terraform/shell), deployment automation, documentation, training scripts, and ML workflows.

Reference architectures emphasize deployment validation over automated testing. Contributors validate changes through actual Azure deployments, which incurs cost. This guide provides cost-transparent guidance for different contribution scopes.

Contributions can include:

* Infrastructure improvements (Terraform modules, networking, security)
* Deployment automation enhancements (shell scripts, Kubernetes manifests)
* Documentation updates (guides, troubleshooting, architecture diagrams)
* Training script optimizations (Python, MLflow integration)
* Workflow templates (AzureML, OSMO)
* Bug fixes and issue resolution

---
title: Document Title
description: Brief description (150 chars max)
author: Microsoft Robotics-AI Team
ms.date: YYYY-MM-DD
ms.topic: concept | how-to | reference | tutorial
---
```

Use ATX-style headers, tables for structured data, GitHub alert syntax for callouts, and language-specified code blocks. Validate with `npm run lint:md`.

For complete Markdown guidance, see [docs-style-and-conventions.instructions.md](../../.github/instructions/docs-style-and-conventions.instructions.md).

## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code Style

Infrastructure code follows strict conventions for consistency, security, and maintainability.

### Key Terraform Conventions

* Format with `terraform fmt -recursive deploy/` before committing
* Use descriptive snake_case variables with prefixes (`enable_`, `is_`, `aks_`)
* Include standard tags on all Azure resources
* Prefer managed identities over service principals
* Store secrets in Key Vault, never in code

### Key Shell Script Conventions

* Begin scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail`
* Include header documentation with prerequisites, environment variables, and usage
* Validate with `shellcheck` before committing

### Copyright Headers

All source files require the Microsoft copyright header:

```text
# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
# Licensed under the MIT License.
```

For complete conventions with examples, see [Infrastructure Style Guide](infrastructure-style.md).

## 🧪 Deployment Validation

This reference architecture validates through deployment rather than automated testing. Choose validation level based on contribution scope and cost constraints.

### Validation Levels

| Level                   | What                                                                   | When to Use                  | Cost   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Level 1: Static**     | `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`, `shellcheck`, `npm run lint:md` | Every contribution           | $0     |
| **Level 2: Plan**       | `terraform plan` with documented output                                | Terraform changes            | $0     |
| **Level 3: Deployment** | Full deployment in dev subscription                                    | Major infrastructure changes | $25-50 |
| **Level 4: Workflow**   | Training job execution                                                 | Script/workflow changes      | $5-30  |

**Static validation is required for all PRs:**

```bash
terraform fmt -check -recursive deploy/
terraform validate deploy/001-iac/
shellcheck deploy/**/*.sh scripts/**/*.sh
npm run lint:md
```

For complete validation procedures, testing templates, and cost optimization strategies, see [Deployment Validation Guide](deployment-validation.md).

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

See the [Pull Request Process](pull-request-process.md) guide for the complete workflow including reviewer assignment, review cycles, approval criteria, and update process.

## 💰 Cost Considerations

Full deployment testing incurs Azure costs. Plan accordingly and destroy resources promptly.

> [!NOTE]
> Cost estimates are approximate and subject to change.
> Use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) for current rates.

### Testing Budget Summary

| Contribution Type   | Typical Cost | Testing Approach          |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Documentation       | $0           | Linting only              |
| Terraform modules   | $10-25       | Plan + short deployment   |
| Training scripts    | $15-30       | Single training job       |
| Full infrastructure | $25-50       | Complete deployment cycle |

### Key Cost Drivers

* GPU VMs: ~$3.06/hour per Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4 node
* Managed services: ~$50-100/month combined (Storage, Key Vault, PostgreSQL, Redis)

### Cost Minimization

```bash
# Single GPU node, public network mode
terraform apply -var="gpu_node_count=1" -var="network_mode=public"

# Always destroy after testing
terraform destroy -auto-approve -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

For component cost breakdowns, budgeting commands, and regional pricing, see [Cost Considerations Guide](cost-considerations.md).

## 🔒 Security Review Process

Security-sensitive contributions require additional review to ensure Azure best practices.

### Security Review Scope

* RBAC and permissions changes
* Private endpoints and networking configuration
* Credential handling and secrets management
* Network policies and firewall rules
* Workload identity configuration

### Key Requirements

* Managed identities over service principals
* Secrets in Key Vault, never in code
* Least privilege RBAC assignments
* Security scanning before PR submission

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** report vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Report to Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). See [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).

For the complete security checklist, dependency update process, and scanning requirements, see [Security Review Guide](security-review.md).
