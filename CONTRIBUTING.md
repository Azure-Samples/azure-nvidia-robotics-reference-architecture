If you are new to the project, start with issues labeled `good first issue` or documentation updates before making larger changes.

## Getting Started

1. Read the [Contributing Guide](docs/contributing/README.md) for prerequisites, workflow, and conventions
2. Review the [Prerequisites](docs/contributing/prerequisites.md) for required tools and Azure access
3. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally
4. Review the [README](README.md) for project overview and architecture
5. Create a descriptive feature branch (for example, `feature/...` or `fix/...`) and follow [Conventional Commits](docs/contributing/README.md#-commit-messages) for commit messages
6. Run [validation](#build-and-validation) before submitting

## I Have a Question

Search existing resources before asking:

- Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-nvidia-robotics-reference-architecture/issues) for similar questions or problems
- Check [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-nvidia-robotics-reference-architecture/discussions) for community Q&A
- Review the [docs/](docs/) directory for troubleshooting guides

If you cannot find an answer, open a [new discussion](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-nvidia-robotics-reference-architecture/discussions/new) in the Q&A category. Provide context about what you are trying to accomplish, what you have tried, and any error messages. For bugs or feature requests, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-nvidia-robotics-reference-architecture/issues/new) instead.

## Development Environment

Run the setup script to configure your local development environment:

```bash
./setup-dev.sh
```

This installs npm dependencies for linting, spell checking, and link validation. See the [Prerequisites](docs/contributing/prerequisites.md) guide for required tools and version requirements.

## Cleanup and Uninstall

Reverse the changes made by `setup-dev.sh` and remove deployed Azure resources.

### Remove Python Environment

The setup script creates a virtual environment at `.venv/` and syncs dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
# Deactivate if currently active
command -v deactivate &>/dev/null && deactivate

# Remove the virtual environment
rm -rf .venv
```

### Remove External Dependencies

The setup script clones IsaacLab for IntelliSense support.

```bash
# Remove IsaacLab clone
rm -rf external/IsaacLab

# Remove Node.js linting dependencies (if installed separately via npm install)
rm -rf node_modules
```

### Clear Package Caches (Optional)

Free disk space by clearing uv and npm caches. This affects all projects using these tools, not just this repository.

```bash
# Clear uv download and build cache
uv cache clean

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force
```

### Destroy Azure Infrastructure

Remove all deployed Azure resources:

```bash
cd deploy/001-iac
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

> [!WARNING]
> `terraform destroy` permanently deletes all deployed Azure resources including AKS clusters, storage accounts, Key Vault, and networking. Back up training data and model checkpoints before running this command.

For automation deployments:

```bash
cd deploy/001-iac/automation
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

Verify no orphaned resources remain:

```bash
az group list --query "[?starts_with(name, 'your-prefix')].name" -o tsv
```

See [Cost Considerations](docs/contributing/cost-considerations.md) for component costs and cleanup timing.

## Build and Validation

Run these commands to validate changes before submitting a PR:

```bash
npm run lint:md        # Markdownlint
npm run lint:links     # Markdown link validation
npm run spell-check    # cspell
```

For Terraform and shell script validation, see the [Prerequisites](docs/contributing/prerequisites.md#build-and-validation-requirements) guide.

## Issue Title Conventions

## Release Process

This project uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated version management. All commits to `main` must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- `feat:` commits trigger a **minor** version bump
- `fix:` commits trigger a **patch** version bump
- `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` commits appear in the changelog without a version bump
- Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer trigger a **major** version bump

After merging to `main`, release-please automatically creates a release PR with updated `CHANGELOG.md` and version bumps. Merging that PR creates a GitHub Release and git tag.

For commit message format details, see [commit-message.instructions.md](.github/instructions/commit-message.instructions.md).

## Testing Requirements

All contributions require appropriate tests. This policy supports code quality and the project's [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/) goals.

### Policy

- New features require accompanying unit tests.
- Bug fixes require regression tests that reproduce the fixed behavior.
- Refactoring changes must not reduce test coverage.

### Regression Testing

At least half of all bug fix PRs must include a regression test.

A regression test is required when:

- The bug affected user-facing functionality
- The fix changes control flow
- The bug could reasonably recur

A regression test may be omitted when:

- The bug was in documentation only
- The fix is purely cosmetic (whitespace, formatting)
- A test is technically impractical (requires external services that cannot be mocked)

#### What Counts as a Regression Test

| Test Type                              | Counts as Regression Test                |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Unit test verifying the fix            | Yes                                      |
| Integration test covering the scenario | Yes                                      |
| Manual test documented in PR           | Only if automated test is impractical    |
| Informal local verification            | No                                       |

#### Bug Fix PR Requirements

When submitting a bug fix:

1. Link to the issue being fixed
2. Include a regression test, or document why one is omitted
3. Describe what the test verifies

Reviewers verify regression tests are included. Compliance is tracked over time via PR labels (`has-regression-test`, `regression-test-omitted`).

### Running Tests

Once a `tests/` directory exists, run the full test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Run tests within the devcontainer:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

Run tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest tests/
coverage report -m
```

### Test Organization

Tests mirror the source directory structure under `tests/`:

| Source Path                     | Test Path                     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `src/training/utils/env.py`     | `tests/unit/test_env.py`      |
| `src/training/utils/metrics.py` | `tests/unit/test_metrics.py`  |
| `src/common/cli_args.py`        | `tests/unit/test_cli_args.py` |

### Test Categories

| Marker        | Description                        | Planned CI Behavior           |
|---------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| *(default)*   | Unit tests, fast, no external deps | Always runs                   |
| `slow`        | Tests exceeding 5 seconds          | Runs on main, optional on PRs |
| `integration` | Requires external services         | Runs on main only             |
| `gpu`         | Requires CUDA runtime              | Excluded from standard CI     |

Skip categories selectively:

```bash
pytest tests/ -m "not slow and not gpu"
```

### Coverage Targets

Coverage thresholds increase with each milestone:

| Milestone | Minimum Coverage |
|-----------|------------------|
| v0.4.0    | 40%              |
| v0.5.0    | 60%              |
| v0.6.0    | 80%              |

These coverage levels are contribution targets for local test runs. CI enforcement of coverage thresholds is planned for a future milestone.

### Configuration

Pytest and coverage are not yet centrally configured in `pyproject.toml`. When adding tests, follow standard pytest conventions (a `tests/` directory with shared fixtures as needed) and align with existing tests in this repository.

### Shell and Infrastructure Tests

Use [BATS-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for shell script tests, [Pester v5](https://pester.dev/) for PowerShell tests, and the native `terraform test` framework for Terraform modules. When adding tests, include framework-specific details in the README for each area.

## Documentation Maintenance

Documentation stays current through update triggers, ownership rules, and freshness reviews. See the [Documentation Maintenance](docs/contributing/documentation-maintenance.md) guide for the complete policy including review criteria, PR requirements, and release lifecycle.
