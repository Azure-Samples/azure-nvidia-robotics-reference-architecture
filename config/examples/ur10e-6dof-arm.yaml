# ROS 2 Edge Recording Configuration - UR10E 6-DOF Robotic Arm
#
# Example configuration for recording episodes from a UR10E 6-degree-of-freedom
# robotic arm with vision and IMU sensors. Episodes start/stop via GPIO trigger.
#
# Platform: Universal Robots UR10E (6-DOF collaborative robot)
# Sensors: RGB camera, IMU, joint encoders
# Trigger: GPIO physical button

# Topics to record - lz4 compression for high-frequency streams, zstd for images
topics:
  - name: /joint_states
    frequency_hz: 100.0
    compression: lz4         # Fast compression for 100 Hz joint state stream

  - name: /camera/color/image_raw
    frequency_hz: 30.0
    compression: zstd        # Higher compression ratio for RGB frames

  - name: /imu/data
    frequency_hz: 200.0
    compression: lz4         # Fast compression for 200 Hz IMU stream

  - name: /gripper/state
    frequency_hz: 50.0
    compression: none        # Low-frequency gripper state, no compression needed

# GPIO trigger - physical button/switch for episode recording
trigger:
  type: gpio
  pin: 17                    # BCM GPIO 17 (physical pin 11 on 40-pin header)
  active_high: true          # Trigger on rising edge

# Disk monitoring - prevents storage exhaustion during long recording sessions
disk_thresholds:
  warning_percent: 80
  critical_percent: 95

# Gap detection - identifies missing messages for quality assurance
gap_detection:
  threshold_ms: 100.0        # 100ms threshold balances sensitivity with false positives
  severity: warning
