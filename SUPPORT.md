# Support

Thank you for using the Azure NVIDIA Robotics Reference Architecture! This document explains how to get help with issues, questions, and contributions.

## How to Get Support

### Community Support

This is an open-source reference architecture maintained by Microsoft and community contributors. We provide community support through GitHub issue tracking with the following response commitments:

| Priority Level | Description | Response Time Target |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Security Vulnerability | Security issues (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)) | 24 hours (via MSRC) |
| Critical | Blocking issues preventing deployment | 1-2 business days |
| Major | Significant issues affecting functionality | 3-5 business days |
| General Issues & Questions | Bug reports, feature requests, questions | Best effort |

**Note**: Response times indicate initial acknowledgment. Resolution time varies based on issue complexity and community availability.

## Filing Issues

### General Issues, Bugs, and Feature Requests

1. **Search existing issues** in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-nvidia-robotics-reference-architecture/issues)
2. **Create a new issue** if yours isn't already tracked: [New Issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-nvidia-robotics-reference-architecture/issues/new/choose)
3. **Provide details**:
   - Clear description of the problem or request
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, Azure region, component versions)

### Security Vulnerabilities
